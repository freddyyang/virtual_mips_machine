virtual_mips_machine
====================

Mips simulator simulates a full machine similar to a MIPS processor. This is a fully-functional CPU that implements a small subset of the MIPS instruction set. It is designed to display the functionality of the processor along with performance statistics. The instruction cycle of MIPS machine, which contains fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback, is fully implemented with C language.
